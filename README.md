# Crystal Vibes
This project uses javascript and jQuery to render a number guessing game. 

A random number between 19 and 120 is displayed, and a random number between 1 and 12 is assigned to each of four crystal buttons but is not displayed.

When a player clicks on a button, the value is added to a score below the buttons and if the player can match the random number displayed, a win is recorded. 
If the player goes over a loss is recorded.

Button values are displayed in the console for testing.
